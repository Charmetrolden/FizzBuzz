FizzBuzz
Through years of research, the government has found out that kids are terrible at the game FizzBuzz.

Therefore, the government has decided to develop an application that emits the correct output when a number is input. This application has been underway for a few years, but the original team has been fired due to cuts in government funds. However, abandoning the project is a waste of taxpayers' money, so now you have been hired to finish the project.

The rules of FizzBuzz are simple, given a number:

If the number is dividable by 3, "Fizz" is returned.
If the number is dividable by 5, "Buzz" is returned.
If the number is dividable by 3 and 5, "FizzBuzz" is returned.
If none of the conditions above is met, the number is returned.
Your job is to implement a FizzBuzz function that returns the right output given a number.

Example
Given the input: 5
You should return: "Buzz"

Solution
Implement your solution by fixing the TODO's on the template of your choice. ðŸ™‚

What you'll be evaluated on
When implementing this function, you should include comments in the code to reflect your thoughts on the decisions made regarding style and logic. A clean solution gets a better score.
